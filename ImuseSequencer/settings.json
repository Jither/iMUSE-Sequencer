  // Preferred MIDI output device for each sound target. Use "ImuseSequencer list-outputs" to see available outputs on your OS.
  // The output can be specified using the integer ID that Windows assigns - but that is rather useless if devices are disconnected/reconnected.
  // Instead, you can specify part of the name (any part), and the first device with the given string in its name will be chosen.
  // Prepend the name/ID with "s:" to use Windows MIDI streaming (recommended), rather than the managed scheduler, which is likely to be less precise.
